I used a mutex, a conditonal variable, and a integer that I could test to control the order. Inside pickUpChoptstick, i first locked the mutex. After that i used pindex inorder to find out if it was the calling threads turn (pindex == threadIndex). If it was not cond_wait() would put the thread to sleep and release the lock. I used a while loop so that I could keep checking pindex everytime the thread woke up. If it was the threads turn, the program continues by calling eating, and then putDownChopsticks. Here, I increased pindex (pindex++), so that it was now equal to the next thread's id. Afterwards I used cond_broadcast, in order to wake up all of the threads, and finally i unlocked the mutex, so that the next thread in line could obtain it.
